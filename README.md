## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Ping Identity DevOps User and Key](https://pingidentity-devops.gitbook.io/devops/getstarted/devopsregistration)

## Getting Started

Update **devops** with your `PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER` and `PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY`.  Also provide your response to `PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA`.  I suggest **YES**, but make sure you review the terms for yourself.

## Starting

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```
